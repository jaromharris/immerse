mwkmwkmwk's words of wisdom about Yosy Equivalence checking
"Don't run `prep` after `equiv_make`" https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/issues/2886

"You need to use either `clk2fflogic` or `async2sync` pass before equivalence checking whenever asynchronous logic is involved." https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/issues/2865
