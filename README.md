mwkmwkmwk's words of wisdom about Yosy Equivalence checking

"Don't run `prep` after `equiv_make`" https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/issues/2886

"You need to use either `clk2fflogic` or `async2sync` pass before equivalence checking whenever asynchronous logic is involved." https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/issues/2865

Okay I also read a thing that said hierarchy should be the first command after read_verilog http://www.clifford.at/yosys/files/yosys_presentation.pdf
